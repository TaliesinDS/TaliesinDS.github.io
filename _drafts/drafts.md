I lost contact with so many people in the past who could have become life long friends if i didn't ghost them because of anxiety about how to interact with them.

Like i say one wrong thing or do one wrong thing, a thing that might not even be wrong, it just appears like that to me because i did not understand the reactions of people at the time, and after that i am afraid of reaching out first and the longer it takes the worst it gets and if they don't decide to reach out to me first i well end up never contacting them again.

And this is weird because when other people do or say something that might be "off", like making a joke about something after a few beers and the topic just happens to be something i am sensitive about, i don't judge them (a lot) or think "that one minute interaction defines how i see you now and all the other things i know about you are forgotten" so it's odd that i think other people  hold me to that standard and expect every action and word to be perfect and without fault but i can't help it, that's just how my brain works.

In times when they do end up reaching out to me, like just to ask how it's going or to invite me to something i haven't done before, instead of saying "hey that sounds fun, let's go" i panick and say "i can't" or "i'll think about it" and get so anxious for no reason at all i end up flaking and they will stop asking me or contacting me after that.

It's especially hard because i have never managed to make friends who actually live close to me so i or them can't just decide to hop over, it would take hours for them and for me with my phobia for public transportation (which started when i was around 20) it's impossible.

Like i want to reach out or respond to emails but i get anxious when i start doing it so i tell myself "i'll do it tomorrow when i feel better, when i'm less stresssed and have a clear head", that turns into a week later and then i get even more anxious about it because i feel ashamed for taking so long to respond and the pressure keeps building up like that until it's 6 months later and i completely give up on that particular line of communication.

Of course this is just about maintaining excisting relations i somehow managed to build despite my best efforts to prevent it XD
When it comes to creating new relations it's even more difficult.
My first meeting with someone usually goes something like this: 
New person walks in the door: "oh he looks fit and handsome, does he sport? He seems to take care of how he dresses, i look like a slob and i'm overweight, he prolly wouldn't like me, i am too different from him, he doesn't look like someone who likes the things i do and prolly wouldn't want to listen to me talking on and on about my hobbies,  i don't feel comfortable, i want him to leave so i can go to my room and hide."


I have some friends that live close by and i promised i would visit them next time because i feel guilty making them come here all the time but that was years ago and i never managed to take the step to actually visit them and telling them "i can't do it" is too hard.

Losing Contact
There are so many moments and friendships in my life that slipped away, not because I wanted them to, but because anxiety and uncertainty got in the way. This isn’t a story about blaming anyone (least of all the people who tried to keep in touch), but about how hard it can be to hold onto connections when your mind keeps building walls. What follows is a look at the patterns and thoughts that shaped my relationships, and maybe, if you recognize yourself in any of this, you’ll know you’re not alone.

Meeting People is Hard
If keeping old friendships alive is tough, meeting new people feels almost impossible. My first meeting with someone usually goes like this:
New person walks in the door: “Oh he looks fit and handsome, does he sport? He seems to take care of how he dresses. I look like a slob and I’m overweight. He probably wouldn’t like me. I am too different from him. He doesn’t look like someone who likes the things I do and probably wouldn’t want to listen to me talking on and on about my hobbies. I don’t feel comfortable. I want him to leave so I can go to my room and hide.” I size them up in seconds, inventing a whole story about why we’ll never get along. It’s exhausting, and sometimes I wish I could just skip to the part where we’re friends.

Overthinking Every Word
Like I say one thing I think was wrong. It might not even be wrong; I just didn’t understand their reaction. After that I’m afraid of reaching out first. The longer I wait the worse it gets. If they don’t reach out to me I end up never contacting them. I replay the conversation in my head, picking apart every word, convinced I messed up. Days pass, and the silence between us grows heavier.

One time, I was working at a small company with about a dozen people. We had a party with BBQ and drinks, and I was chatting with two senior coworkers, both women. Late in the evening, after everyone had relaxed and had a few drinks, one of them (let's call her Christa) made a rather naughty joke that I found hilarious. Over the weekend, I came up with a brilliant comeback, and the next Monday at the first coffee break, I walked into the break room with all my coworkers present and delivered my even naughtier comeback to Christa out loud. Half the people nearly spit out their coffee and stared at me like, "wtf dude." Christa explained to me why that was inappropriate, that things said during drinks shouldn't be repeated during the day, and in the end we could all laugh about it. But I've had plenty of moments like these that didn't end with everyone smiling, and those are the ones I keep replaying in my head, wondering what people must think of me.

Usually, people don't tell me what I said or did wrong—they just ignore me or quietly shun me, and I'm left guessing, overthinking, and feeling more alone.

Double Standards in My Mind
When people don't respond to me positively, or at all (when they seem to ignore what I said), I feel like I must have said something wrong, offended somebody, or that they don't approve of me.
I often wonder why I’m so much harder on myself than I am on other people. It’s like I have two sets of rules, one for everyone else, and one for me.
This is weird because when other people do or say something “off,” like a joke after a few beers that hits something I’m sensitive about, I don’t throw them out or decide that one minute defines them, so it’s odd that I think everyone else will do exactly that to me and expect every single thing I say to be spotless; I can’t help it, that’s just how my brain works. I forgive others for their awkward moments, but when it’s me, I act like the world is keeping score.

It doesn't help that I do sometimes do things that are wrong. One time, a classmate asked if he could have a talk with me and led me to a private spot. When I followed him, he told me that the way I always try to one-up everyone is going to alienate me, and that I need to work on that. At the moment it felt like a slap in the face, but I just thanked him for the feedback. Later, I thought about it and realized he was totally right. Often, when someone was talking about a subject, I would come in with a different story on the subject but "bigger" than their version. In my mind, this was how people interacted. I thought it was like telling tall tales around the campfire, the way you see in movies. But in reality, people were sharing their personal story, and then the annoying guy shows up to one-up them.

The Panic of Being Invited
When they do reach out to me, like asking how it’s going or inviting me to something I haven’t done before, instead of saying “Hey that sounds fun, let’s go,” I panic and say “I can’t” or “I’ll think about it.” I get so anxious for no real reason that I end up flaking, and then after that has happened a few times they will stop asking me out or even contacting me. An invite pops up and my mind goes blank. I want to say yes, but the words get stuck. I mumble something vague, and later, I regret it.

Why Visits Feel Impossible
It’s especially hard because I’ve never managed to make friends who live close to me, so I or them can’t just decide to hop over. It would take hours for them, and for me with my phobia of public transportation (which I developed around age 20), it’s impossible. The last time I tried to go somewhere with the train, I had a panic attack the moment the doors closed. I had to get out at the next station and needed an hour to recover before I could take the train back again. The thought of trains and buses makes my chest tighten. I wish I could just walk over, knock on their door, and hang out like in the movies.

Maintaining Relationships
I open my email, see a message from an old friend, and my heart starts racing. I stare at the screen, fingers hovering over the keyboard, but every word I think of sounds wrong. "I’ll do it tomorrow," I promise myself, “when I feel better, when I’m less stressed and have a clear head.” That turns into a week later, and then I get even more anxious because I feel ashamed for taking so long to respond. The pressure keeps building until it’s six months later and I completely give up on that line of communication.

Promises I Can't Keep
I have some friends who live close by and I promised I would visit them next time because I feel guilty making them come here all the time, but that was years ago. I never managed to take the step to actually visit them, and telling them “I can’t do it, please come visit me again” is too hard to actually do for some reason.

A Note to My Friends
If any of those people are reading this right now: I don’t hate you or even dislike you; I do want to talk, but I’m often unable to reach out first, so if you want to chat, keep nudging me and I will eventually respond (I hope).
