I lost contact with so many people in the past who could have become life long friends if i didn't ghost them because of anxiety about how to interact with them.

Like i say one wrong thing or do one wrong thing, a thing that might not even be wrong, it just appears like that to me because i did not understand the reactions of people at the time, and after that i am afraid of reaching out first and the longer it takes the worst it gets and if they don't decide to reach out to me first i well end up never contacting them again.

And this is weird because when other people do or say something that might be "off", like making a joke about something after a few beers and the topic just happens to be something i am sensitive about, i don't judge them (a lot) or think "that one minute interaction defines how i see you now and all the other things i know about you are forgotten" so it's odd that i think other people  hold me to that standard and expect every action and word to be perfect and without fault but i can't help it, that's just how my brain works.

In times when they do end up reaching out to me, like just to ask how it's going or to invite me to something i haven't done before, instead of saying "hey that sounds fun, let's go" i panick and say "i can't" or "i'll think about it" and get so anxious for no reason at all i end up flaking and they will stop asking me or contacting me after that.

It's especially hard because i have never managed to make friends who actually live close to me so i or them can't just decide to hop over, it would take hours for them and for me with my phobia for public transportation (which started when i was around 20) it's impossible.

Like i want to reach out or respond to emails but i get anxious when i start doing it so i tell myself "i'll do it tomorrow when i feel better, when i'm less stresssed and have a clear head", that turns into a week later and then i get even more anxious about it because i feel ashamed for taking so long to respond and the pressure keeps building up like that until it's 6 months later and i completely give up on that particular line of communication.

Of course this is just about maintaining excisting relations i somehow managed to build despite my best efforts to prevent it XD
When it comes to creating new relations it's even more difficult.
My first meeting with someone usually goes something like this: 
New person walks in the door: "oh he looks fit and handsome, does he sport? He seems to take care of how he dresses, i look like a slob and i'm overweight, he prolly wouldn't like me, i am too different from him, he doesn't look like someone who likes the things i do and prolly wouldn't want to listen to me talking on and on about my hobbies,  i don't feel comfortable, i want him to leave so i can go to my room and hide."


I have some friends that live close by and i promised i would visit them next time because i feel guilty making them come here all the time but that was years ago and i never managed to take the step to actually visit them and telling them "i can't do it" is too hard.

Rewritten draft (same voice, lightly cleaned) 

I lost contact with so many people in the past who could have become lifelong friends if I didn’t ghost them because of anxiety about how to interact with them.

Like I say one thing I think was wrong. It might not even be wrong; I just didn’t understand their reaction. After that I’m afraid of reaching out first. The longer I wait the worse it gets. If they don’t reach out to me I end up never contacting them.

This is weird because when other people do or say something “off,” like a joke after a few beers that hits something I’m sensitive about, I don’t throw them out or decide that one minute defines them, so it’s odd that I think everyone else will do exactly that to me and expect every single thing I say to be spotless; I can’t help it, that’s just how my brain works.

When they do reach out to me, like asking how it’s going or inviting me to something I haven’t done before, instead of saying “Hey that sounds fun, let’s go,” I panic and say “I can’t” or “I’ll think about it.” I get so anxious for no real reason that I end up flaking, and then after that has happened a few times they will stop asking me out or even contacting me.

It’s especially hard because I’ve never managed to make friends who live close to me, so I or them can’t just decide to hop over. It would take hours for them, and for me with my phobia of public transportation (which I developed around age 20), it’s impossible.

I want to reach out or respond to emails, but I get anxious the moment I open the email program. Then I tell myself “I’ll do it tomorrow when I feel better, when I’m less stressed and have a clear head.” That turns into a week later, and then I get even more anxious because I feel ashamed for taking so long to respond. The pressure keeps building until it’s six months later and I completely give up on that line of communication.

Of course this is just about maintaining existing relations I somehow managed to build despite my brain's best efforts to prevent it. When it comes to creating new relations it’s even more difficult. My first meeting with someone usually goes like this:
New person walks in the door: “Oh he looks fit and handsome, does he sport? He seems to take care of how he dresses. I look like a slob and I’m overweight. He probably wouldn’t like me. I am too different from him. He doesn’t look like someone who likes the things I do and probably wouldn’t want to listen to me talking on and on about my hobbies. I don’t feel comfortable. I want him to leave so I can go to my room and hide.”

I have some friends who live close by and I promised I would visit them next time because I feel guilty making them come here all the time, but that was years ago. I never managed to take the step to actually visit them, and telling them “I can’t do it, please come visit me again” is too hard to actually do for some reason.

If any of those people are reading this right now: I don’t hate you or even dislike you; I do want to talk, but I’m often unable to reach out first, so if you want to chat, keep nudging me and I will eventually respond (I hope).
